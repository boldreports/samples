## Why this sample?

The [Bold Reports V2 report viewer offers a feature](https://help.boldreports.com/embedded-reporting/javascript-reporting/report-viewer/how-to/migrate-report-viewer-v2/) to automatically hide the floating report toolbar after a specific duration, enhancing user experience when scrolling through data-rich first pages. This functionality is achieved using the `AutoHideDelay` property within the toolbar settings. By default, the toolbar disappears after 5 seconds, but users can customize this duration as needed. It avoids the scenario where the toolbar covers essential report content, providing unobstructed access to data.
